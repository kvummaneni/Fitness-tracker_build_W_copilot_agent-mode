ðŸš€ Exploring AI-Powered Development with GitHub Copilot ðŸš€

Hi everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I recently embarked on an exciting journey to build a fitness tracker app called Octofit Tracker for Merington High School. Inspired by the Monafit Tracker, this project was my first attempt at creating a full-stack application using Django, React, MongoDB, and Bootstrapâ€”all with no prior experience in JavaScript, CSS, or coding!
